# AugACM-Site

The new Augsburg ACM website is currently being developed with Reactjs and TypeScript for the frontend.  For the backend we will be using Firebase

## How to get started

To run the app, you must have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/), and the [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). 

Before you are able to start the webserver, run the following command:
```bash
yarn
```
To start a local webserver to view the app, run the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

if you are using MacOS or Linux, you might need to run with sudo:

```bash
sudo yarn start
```

Your main entry point to edit the application is in `src/App.tsx`.  From here, you can make modifications that will be rendered to the page.

Happy hacking!
